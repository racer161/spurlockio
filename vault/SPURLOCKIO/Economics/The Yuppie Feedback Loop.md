There is a problem where prospective skilled laborers who were selected to go to college outside of meritocratic processes because they played the "academia game" only have 2 options once they get their first real job. They can admit their incompetency and leave the job they are not qualified for or they can find a way to take advantage of their initial position of power and leverage that power to gain more power. 

You can play the tangible game others have agreed to or play around the loopholes of the game itself to take advantage of those below you and beside you.

The reward for playing the normal game is well defined. The *crumbling* American Dream. 

The reward for the intangible game is not well defined and risky but the payoff is higher.

The point is that, If you truly understand you are incompetent at your job and realize you will never be a great ___ , the thing you went to school for, then you are incentivized to mislead and take advantage of others.

We have failed to address this problem because its uncomfortable to talk about the reality where people are not fit to do what they were trained to do or what they want to do.
