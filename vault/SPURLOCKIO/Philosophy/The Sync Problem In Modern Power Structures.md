>Because the distribution of wealth and power is skewed greatly to one end, The Participants at the top are incentivized to impress their influence on the next most influential person. This is because impressing many people at the bottom of the distribution has virtually no impact on overall status relative to the gain to be had by impressing a single person near the top.
### Backlash as an Example
Backlash happens when many people at the bottom employ social democracy to force the hand of an influential person or corporate entity. The entity acts to stop the bleeding not because it cares about the opinions of the complaining people but because it stands to lose face in front of those influential people at the top. Public opinion holds almost no direct power but it holds much indirect power because influential people care about the impression other influential people have about them. As you rise up the totem pole, this problem only becomes more exacerbated due to the effect explained above.
