### Greedy algorithms
When everyone has their own best interests **and** everyone is competent enough to realize the optimal outcome, greed transcends individual interest to become a hive mind of workers looking to achieve the global minima.

### Highways are Greedy, but not the good kind.
If everyone used google maps to go to work in the morning and we didn't have highways, you might take a different path each day but you would definitely arrive sooner than you do now.
Why?: 
	- Optimal Algorithm can react to dynamic events (accidents, )
	- People need to go to different places but highway assumes everyone needs to go to the same place. This causes traffic to
