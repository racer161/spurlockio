A Philosophy that focuses on Direction and Speed instead of Acceleration and Destination.
### [[Which Is Best]]
The problem with making the best choice in any situation is that it presupposes perfect knowledge of all future outcomes of the choice. So you should always make the choice that gives you more choices. Even if it hurts.

### [[Quality over Opinion]]
There will always be debate about the correct approach to a goal. At every choice, a decision is made to either accept the status quo or to seek an absolute truth via any means necessary. Only ignoring the opinion of external forces and focusing on the collected ground truth available will lead you to a better understanding of reality and a better understanding of which is best.

### [[You Only Go to War When You Can Win Easily]]
Academics are prone to the analytical approach which can only be satisfied by a higher truth or close form solution to a problem. You have to accept that you can't know everything and instead chose the battles that are intrinsic to your identity. I want to know this because knowing it will impart great meaning to my life. Then you will win easily.
