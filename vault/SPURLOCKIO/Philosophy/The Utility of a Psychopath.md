#### The Problem with Being Reasonable
A society governed by an appointed set of reasonable lawmakers will design laws that cover all the edge cases that a reasonable person might encounter. These rules hold implicit biases about societal norms and expectations. If an average empathetic citizen encounters an edge case not explicitly covered the idea behind the laws is that it would not even occur to the citizen to think to do something outside the law.

Like a mirror (to a blind man), the amazing psychopath reveals to us exactly what we were not seeing as a society.
