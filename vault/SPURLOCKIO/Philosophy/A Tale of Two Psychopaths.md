> Being psychopath without having an objective model of the world leads to disaster. Any amount of narcissism, lack of experience with social situations, or inability to accept change will cause a psychopath's world model to lose sync with reality since they  aren't anchored by the opinions of others. 

### The Psychopath You Know Isn't Better Than The One You Don't
Society can easily tolerate a psychopath who betters society at the cost of social mores, but it cannot tolerate one who is only self interested. This type of person not only lacks empathy and restraint, but lacks the cognitive bandwidth to understand the world and therefore offers no utility. They are a whirlwind of destruction in your life from the moment you meet them until you finally tell them to "fuck off" because they lack the capacity to do anything but take.

Despite this egregious condition, both types of psychopath find their successful place in the world, because the one who is only self interested after getting their hand caught in the cookie jar will simply move on to the next unwitting victim. Relentless narcissism and the splintered crutch that "things will be different this time" leads them to take and take without understanding the burden they place on society and that they are the problem.

### The Other Psychopath
By logical standards, choosing to only engage in emotional bias with the people you keep close and using cold surgical clean rational to make decisions about all people, places, and things other is an ideal strategy in a world where ordinary people cannot be trusted. In practice, even the coldest psycho killers probably find it hard to act in this way because even they are engaged in a loving (or hating) relationship with themselves.

Indeed, the attributes that make psychopaths seem cold and empty can make them endearing and inspiring.
